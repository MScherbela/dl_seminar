Deep convolutional networks have become a popular tool for image generation and restoration. 
Generally, their excellent performance is imputed to their ability to learn realistic image priors from a large number of example images. 
In this paper, we show that, on the contrary, the structure of a generator network is sufficient to capture a great deal of low-level image statistics prior to any learning.
